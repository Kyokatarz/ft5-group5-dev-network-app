## Introduction

Hi, thanks for your interest in my application. You can watch the app grow at:

```

You can clone this app to your local machine, but it will need mongoDBCompass to run. Take a look at [mongoDBCompass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass).

This app was built as a training ground for my NextJS and GraphQL skills. It presents a place where developers and hiring companies can interact with each others and expand their network.
